# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Ticket management

Tickets live in Linear under the **Tubekeep** project (team **0xCode**, key `0XC`).

## Commands

```bash
# Start both services for local dev (recommended)
./start.sh

# Backend only
cd backend && npm run dev      # nodemon auto-reload
cd backend && npm start        # production
cd backend && npm run cleanup  # run cleanup once and exit

# Frontend only
cd frontend && npm run dev     # Vite dev server (port 5173), proxies /api → :3001
cd frontend && npm run build   # production build to dist/
cd frontend && npm run preview # preview built dist/ (port 4173), proxies /api → :3001

# Lint & format (Biome) — run from the repo root, covers both frontend and backend
npm run lint                   # biome check .  (lint + format diagnostics, no writes)
npm run format                 # biome format --write .  (apply formatting)
npm run check                  # biome check --write .  (apply safe lint fixes + formatting)
```

Backend tests are plain `node:test` files colocated with the source (`*.test.js`), run with `cd backend && npm test` (`node --test`). There is no frontend test setup. Linting/formatting is [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) via a single root `biome.json`; the `frontend/` and `backend/` packages each also expose `npm run lint` / `npm run format` that shell out to the same root-installed Biome.

**CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)** gates every PR with three parallel jobs — `lint` (root `npm run lint`), `test` (`cd backend && npm test`), `build` (`cd frontend && npm run build`) — so a failing backend test or a broken frontend build blocks the PR the same way a lint error does. The suite is hermetic: it needs no `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, database, or network access (`backend/test/ytdlp.test.js` fakes the `yt-dlp` binary rather than spawning the real one). `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs the same three checks — its `lint`/`test`/`build-frontend` jobs, not to be confused with its separate, pre-existing `build` job that builds the Docker image — before that image build, since `deploy.yml` also fires on the daily scheduled rebuild and on manual `workflow_dispatch`, neither of which goes through a PR.

**Single-server mode:** if `frontend/dist/` exists, `backend` serves it statically with an SPA fallback (see `server.js`). So `cd frontend && npm run build` then `cd backend && npm start` serves the whole app on port 3001 with no separate frontend process. This is how production runs.

## Architecture

**Tubekeep** — a yt-dlp-backed video/audio downloader. React SPA (Vite, port 5173 in dev) + Express API (port 3001) + the `yt-dlp` CLI. Downloads land in `backend/downloads/<downloadId>/` and are *expired* (not hard-deleted) after `MAX_FILE_AGE_HOURS` (**1h**, `services/cleanup.js`).

### Download flow
1. `GET /api/info?url=...` → `services/ytdlp.js` runs `yt-dlp --dump-json`, returns formats grouped into `{ video, audio, combined }`.
2. `POST /api/download` → mints a `downloadId` (a UUID) **and starts the download job** server-side via the download manager. The parameters ride the **request body** (`url`, `formatId`, `type`, `title`, `thumbnail`, `keep`, `filesize`). The job runs yt-dlp to completion **independent of any client connection** — navigating away no longer aborts it. Three guards run here, all before any job starts, in this order: (1) the client-passed `filesize` against the **per-user quota** (`hasQuotaFor` over `store.usageForUser`) → **HTTP 507**; (2) the same size against the **global disk** fit margin (`hasRoomFor`) → **HTTP 507** too; (3) the concurrency cap, which `startJob` throws (`DownloadCapError`) → **HTTP 429**. All are `{ success: false, error }` the UI surfaces inline. Between (2) and (3) the download is **recorded in the `downloads` table** under the requesting user (as `status: 'downloading'`), so an in-flight download survives a reload — a cap rejection therefore deletes that row again before returning 429, and a failed insert aborts the start with a 500. The job's terminal hooks (`onComplete`/`onError`, injected into `startJob`) flip the row to `complete` (writing the real filename + on-disk size) or `failed`.
3. `GET /api/download/progress/:downloadId` → **pure observer SSE.** It looks the job up in the registry, replays current progress, and streams `progress` / `complete` / `error` events plus `ping` heartbeats every 15s (for proxy keep-alive). It **does not spawn a process**; disconnecting only unsubscribes (the job keeps running). Reconnecting (reload / new tab / cold visit) **attaches** to the in-flight job — no second process, no query params needed. An unknown id (e.g. after a server restart) yields a terminal `"download not found"` error.
4. `DELETE /api/download/:downloadId` → **explicit cancel.** Aborts the running job (via its `AbortController`), removes its partial files/directory, and drops the caller's history row (`store.deleteForUser`, so another user's id reads as 404) — a cancelled download must not linger in the list or against the quota. Succeeds if *either* half found something; 404 only when neither did. Wired to the `DownloadingCard` **Dismiss** and the download page **Cancel**.
5. `GET /api/files/:downloadId/:filename` → serves the file with HTTP range support (in-browser seeking/streaming) and RFC 5987 `Content-Disposition` for unicode filenames. `?action=download` forces an attachment.

**Download manager (`services/downloadManager.js`)** — an in-memory `Map<downloadId, job>` registry. Each job holds `{ status: 'running'|'complete'|'error', progress, result, error, params, hooks, emitter, abortController }`. Observers attach through `subscribe(downloadId, { onProgress, onComplete, onError })`, which atomically replays the job's current/terminal state and then streams live events (returning an unsubscribe fn, or `null` for an unknown id) — the `emitter` stays internal so the observer route is a thin SSE serializer. On completion the job writes `metadata.json` (moved out of the route) — still the filesystem-side record the age-based cleanup sweep, the cloud-move job and `getDownload` read — and then awaits `hooks.onComplete` (which persists the real filename + size to the user's `downloads` row) **before** emitting `complete`, so a client that reloads the instant it sees the event reads a matching row. Hook failures are caught and logged (`runHook`): a DB blip must never turn a finished download into a failed one. Note the history *listing* now comes from Postgres, not from `metadata.json`. **In-memory only** — an in-flight download dies on server restart (a reconnect then gets "download not found"); terminal jobs are retained ~30 min for late reconnects, then pruned by the hourly cleanup sweep (`sweepJobs`). The concurrency cap is `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` (default **3**) simultaneously-running jobs.

**Storage guards (`GET /api/disk`, `routes/disk.js`)** — two independent limits, both enforced at `POST /api/download` and both surfaced to the format screen by one endpoint. The response is `{ total, free, used, sizeMultiplier, headroomBytes, quota: { used, max, remaining } }`.

- **Global free disk** (server housekeeping): `hasRoomFor(free, filesize)` — `free >= filesize * DISK_SIZE_MULTIPLIER (2×) + DISK_HEADROOM_BYTES (500 MB)`. The `2×` covers the transient video+audio merge.
- **Per-user quota** (the user's allowance): `hasQuotaFor(used, max, filesize)` — `used + filesize <= max`, where `max` is the `users.max_storage_bytes` column (default 5 GB, **`-1` = unlimited**) and `used` is `SUM(filesize)` of that user's live rows (`NOT expired AND NOT moved AND status <> 'failed'` — an in-flight `downloading` row counts, so parallel starts can't race past the cap). **No** multiplier/headroom here: the quota counts what a download *keeps*, not its merge footprint.

Both live in `utils/storage.js` and the frontend reads the same knobs + quota numbers back out of the `/api/disk` response (`hasRoomFor` / `hasQuotaFor` / `downloadBlockReason` in `lib/media.js`), so client disable-check and server backstop can't drift — the client's `hasQuotaFor` consumes the response's `quota.remaining` rather than re-deriving it from `used`/`max`, so the clamp-at-zero and the `-1` unlimited sentinel are defined once, on the server. `FormatSelector` shows a **"Your storage"** banner (used / left, or "unlimited") and disables any format either guard rejects, with the reason under it. Unknown-size formats are never blocked by either. The client-passed `filesize` is untrusted (a UX guard, not a security boundary) — the row's size is corrected to the real one on completion. The two guards fail differently on error: the quota check **fails closed** (a DB outage must not hand out free storage), the disk check **fails open**.

### yt-dlp integration (`services/ytdlp.js`) — read before touching downloads
This file carries deliberate workarounds for YouTube's 2026-era extraction breakage. Do not "simplify" them away:
- **`YOUTUBE_EXTRACTOR_ARGS = 'youtube:player_client=android_vr;formats=missing_pot'`** is passed to *every* yt-dlp invocation. The default web/tv clients require a JS challenge solver that's broken in yt-dlp 2026.02.x (yields only a single 360p format and hangs). `android_vr` restores the full 144p→4K ladder; `formats=missing_pot` keeps formats whose URLs lack a PO Token. Namespaced under `youtube:` so other extractors are unaffected.
- **SABR retries.** YouTube's per-session SABR experiment intermittently strips format URLs. `getVideoInfo` retries the metadata fetch up to 4× with back-off until video-only formats appear. `downloadVideo`/`downloadAudio` retry up to 3× on `Requested format is not available|SABR|missing a URL`, and use fallback format strings (e.g. `${formatId}+bestaudio/bestvideo+bestaudio/best`) so a vanished exact format still resolves to *something*.
- **Binary & PATH.** Prefers `~/.local/bin/yt-dlp` over the system one, and injects Node's dir into `PATH` because yt-dlp's SABR challenge solver shells out to `node`.
- Video+audio (`type: 'video'`) merges to mp4 via `--merge-output-format mp4`; `type: 'combined'` downloads a pre-merged format as-is; `type: 'audio'` pulls bestaudio.

### Expire vs. delete (two-tier lifecycle)
A download is **"expired"** when its history row survives but the media files are gone. This keeps the row visible so it can be re-downloaded. The **`downloads.expired` column is what the UI reads**; the filesystem's own derivation (directory + `metadata.json` present, `files.length === 0` in `listDownloads`) is what the cleanup sweep reconciles the column against. Two distinct destructive operations, both via `DELETE /api/files/:downloadId`, each touching the row *and* the disk:
- default → `store.expireForUser` + `expireDownload()`: removes media files, keeps metadata, flags the row `expired` + stamps `expired_at`.
- `?permanent=true` → `store.deleteForUser` + `deleteDownload()`: removes the row and the whole directory.

Both are scoped to the caller's own rows — `store.expireForUser`/`deleteForUser` carry the `user_id` in their `WHERE`, so another user's id simply reads as `404`.

The hourly cleanup scheduler (`services/cleanup.js`, `MAX_FILE_AGE_HOURS` = **1**) *expires* old downloads — it does not hard-delete. It then reconciles the `downloads` table against the filesystem (`expireMissing`: any completed, live row whose media is gone is marked expired, no matter who removed it) and retires rows stranded `downloading` by a restart (`failStale`, 6h window), so neither can occupy a user's quota forever. Both reconcile steps need the store, which `server.js` passes in (`startCleanupScheduler({ store })`) — so the standalone `npm run cleanup` CLI, which passes none, is **filesystem-only** and leaves the table to the running server's next sweep. The sweep scans the downloads directory once (`listDownloads()`) and hands that snapshot to `cleanupOldDownloads`, deriving "still on disk" from it rather than walking the tree a second time. The frontend holds the two lists (active + expired) in memory only — they are re-read from the server, **not** localStorage.

**Re-download dedupe — one row per source URL (0XC-10):** when a download **completes**, the user's older rows for the same source URL are hard-deleted (row + media), so a re-download *replaces* the stale entry instead of sitting beside it and the old copy stops occupying the quota. Two states are spared: **moved-to-cloud** rows (the media lives in the user's own cloud and the row still carries the "Open in …" link) and **`downloading`** rows (a concurrent job for the same URL, which deleting would orphan). Expired, failed and live completed rows all go.

This rule is **server-side**, in the download job's `onComplete` hook (`supersedeOlderRows` in `routes/download.js` over `store.supersedeForUser`) — *not* in the browser. It originally lived in `addDownload` and only ran if a tab happened to witness the SSE `complete` event; since downloads finish server-side regardless of the client (0XC-25/0XC-26), leaving the download page is the normal flow, so the dedupe silently never ran and both rows came back on the next sync. Running it in the completion hook is also what makes "only supersede once the new download actually lands" true: an abandoned or failed re-download leaves the old row intact. `supersedeBy` in `HistoryContext.jsx` mirrors the same predicate purely so the list updates instantly — it issues **no** requests, and its spared cases must stay in step with `SUPERSEDABLE_SQL` / `isSupersedable` in `downloadsStore.js`. Matching is exact string equality on the stored `url`; the Redownload button round-trips it verbatim, but a hand-pasted variant (`youtu.be/…`, `&t=`) won't match (0XC-117).

**Pending/failed rows:** downloads run server-side and finish even if the user leaves the download page, so history rows are written **at click time**, not on SSE completion. `handleDownload` (`InfoPage.jsx`) calls `startPending()` to put a `status: 'downloading'` row into the in-memory history list immediately — the server already inserted the real row, this just avoids waiting for a re-sync (fields: `downloadId`, `url`, `type`, `title`, `thumbnail`, `createdAt` — no `filename`/`size` yet). On SSE `complete`, `addDownload(data.data)` replaces it in place with the full completed record (which carries **no** `status`), so it renders as a normal `ActiveCard`. On SSE `error`, `markFailed()` flips it to `status: 'failed'`. `DownloadsPage` routes `status === 'downloading'` → `DownloadingCard` (spinner, links to `/download/:id`, plus a **Dismiss**) and `status === 'failed'` → `FailedCard` (Redownload + Dismiss) **before** the `ActiveCard` fallback. These rows exist **server-side too** (the `POST` inserts them), so a reload re-reads them from the DB — no client-side preservation needed. The two Dismisses differ: a **downloading** row uses `cancelDownload()` — the job runs server-side regardless of the client, so dismissing it must `DELETE /api/download/:id` to actually stop the job (abort + remove partials), which also deletes its history row; a **failed** row uses `dismissFailed()`, a hard-delete (`DELETE /api/files/:id?permanent=true`) rather than a move to the expired list, since its file may never have landed.

### Backend (`backend/src/`)
- **`server.js`** — Express entry (helmet with CSP disabled for media + cross-origin resource policy, CORS, morgan), route mounting, static SPA serving, cleanup scheduler bootstrap.
- **`routes/`** — thin HTTP layer: `info.js`, `download.js` (start job / observer SSE / cancel), `files.js` (range serving + per-user list + expire/delete), `disk.js` (`GET /api/disk` — disk usage + fit knobs + the caller's quota), `cloud.js` (OAuth + move-to-cloud; uses the store only to confirm the caller owns the download). Every router except `info.js` is a **factory** — `createDownloadRouter`/`createDiskRouter`/`createCloudRouter` take `{ store }` and `createFilesRouter(requireAuth, { store })` — taking the injected `downloadsStore`, so they unit-test against `createMemoryStore()` without Postgres. (`auth.js` follows the same pattern over `authStore`.)
- **`services/ytdlp.js`** — all subprocess spawning (see above).
- **`services/downloadManager.js`** — in-memory job registry that runs downloads to completion decoupled from the client SSE; enforces `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` (see Download flow). Takes no database dependency — the caller injects `{ onComplete, onError }` hooks into `startJob` to persist the terminal outcome.
- **`services/cleanup.js`** — hourly scheduler; also runnable standalone (`npm run cleanup`, filesystem-only — no store is registered in that process). Also prunes finished download-job records (`sweepJobs`) and reconciles the `downloads` table (`expireMissing` / `failStale`).
- **`utils/storage.js`** — the source of truth for the directory layout, `metadata.json` I/O, `listDownloads`/`expireDownload`/`deleteDownload`, and both storage guards (`getDiskUsage`/`hasRoomFor` + the fit constants; `hasQuotaFor`/`remainingQuota` + `UNLIMITED_QUOTA`).
- **`services/downloadsStore.js`** — data access for the `downloads` table (per-user history + quota usage), same shape as `authStore`: `createStore(query)` for production, `createMemoryStore()` for tests. `toApiRow` is the single place DB columns become the API/UI contract, and `USAGE_WHERE_SQL` / `countsTowardUsage` are the one quota-usage rule written for each impl (keep them adjacent — they must change together). The **background workers** that run outside any request (the cleanup sweep, the cloud-move job) take the store as an argument from the caller that already holds it (`startCleanupScheduler({ store })`, `createJob({ …, store })`) rather than reaching for a module singleton; omitted in unit tests, where those paths no-op.
- **`utils/friendlyError.js`** — `friendlyYtDlpError(rawMessage)`: maps raw yt-dlp stderr to short, blame-free user copy via an ordered `{ pattern, message }` list (unavailable/removed, private, members-only, age-restricted, geo-blocked, live/premiere, unsupported URL, network/timeout), falling back to a generic message. Matches lowercased substrings anywhere in multi-line stderr, most-specific first. `getVideoInfo`'s catch and `downloadManager`'s `runJob` error path both run every user-facing error through it, so `/api/info` and SSE `error` never leak exit codes, extractor tags, or enforcement-vendor names. The **full raw stderr is still `console.error`-logged** server-side for operators — only the user-facing string is rewritten.

### Auth + database (magic-link login)
Only emails present in a **manually-managed** Neon `users` table can log in — there is **no signup and no admin UI**; add/remove a user or change their quota by editing the `users` row in the Neon dashboard. Login is an emailed single-use magic link → a JWT httpOnly cookie session.

- **`db.js`** — lazily-created `pg` connection pool over `DATABASE_URL` (forces TLS). Exposes `query(text, params)` and `getPool()`. Importing it never connects, so tests that inject their own store don't need a database.
- **`schema.sql`** + **`npm run db:init`** (`src/dbInit.js`) — hand-written schema (no ORM/migrations). Defines `users` (id, email UNIQUE, name, `max_storage_bytes` bigint default 5 GB / `-1` = unlimited), `login_tokens` (stores only the SHA-256 **hash** of each token, single-use + ~15-min expiry), and `downloads` (the per-user download history: lifecycle `status`/`expired`/`moved`+`moved_info`/`kept`, and the `filesize` the quota sums). Idempotent — safe to re-run. Apply once against Neon: `DATABASE_URL=… npm run db:init`.
- **`services/mailer.js`** — `sendMagicLink(email, rawToken)`. Sends via the **Resend** HTTP API when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set; otherwise (dev/tests) **logs the link to the server console** so the flow is testable without credentials. Builds links from `APP_URL`, sends from `EMAIL_FROM`. Never throws to the caller (a mail outage must not leak whether an address was allowed).
- **`services/authService.js`** — Express/Postgres-free crypto + orchestration (so it unit-tests in isolation): token `generate`/`hash`, JWT `signSession`/`verifySession` (reads `JWT_SECRET`, 30-day expiry), and `requestMagicLink`/`verifyMagicLink`. Token consumption is a single atomic `UPDATE … WHERE used_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()` in the store, which is what enforces single-use even under concurrent clicks.
- **`services/authStore.js`** — data access behind a small interface. `createStore(query)` is the Postgres-backed impl; `createMemoryStore()` implements the same four methods in memory for tests. Routes/middleware take a store so nothing touches Postgres in unit tests.
- **`routes/auth.js`** — `createAuthRouter({ store, mailer })`. `POST /api/auth/request` (rate-limited; **generic response regardless of allowlist**), `GET /api/auth/verify?token=…` (consume token → set cookie → redirect to `APP_URL/?login=success|error`), `POST /api/auth/logout` (clear cookie), `GET /api/auth/me` (session user or 401). Cookie flags: httpOnly + SameSite=Lax always, Secure only in prod.
- **`middleware/requireAuth.js`** — `createRequireAuth(store)` verifies the session cookie JWT, loads the user, and attaches `req.user` (incl. `user_id` for 0XC-100); 401 otherwise. Mounted on **every** API router (`/api/info`, `/api/download`, `/api/disk`, `/api/cloud`, and `/api/files`'s list/PATCH/DELETE) **except** the public `GET /api/files/:downloadId/:filename` serve route, so shared `/play/:id` links keep working for logged-out visitors. CORS runs with `credentials: true` against the **pinned** `FRONTEND_URL` (never a wildcard).
- **Deploy ordering** — because every API route now requires a session, this backend must ship **together with or after** the frontend login UI (0XC-98). Deploying it ahead of 0XC-98 would 401 the existing SPA (which sends no session cookie yet) and lock users out. `db.js` verifies the DB's TLS cert by default (`DATABASE_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true` opts out); the server refuses to boot in production without `JWT_SECRET`.

### Frontend (`frontend/src/`)
Routing-based, **not** a single mega-component (the old `App.jsx`-holds-all-state model is gone):
- **`main.jsx`** — `createBrowserRouter` defines routes; `<AuthProvider>` wraps `<HistoryProvider>` wraps `<PlayerProvider>` wraps the router so auth, history, and player state are all global. `/login` and `/oauth/callback` are standalone (outside the `App` shell); everything under `/` is in the shell, with the public `play/:downloadId` declared **before** the `<ProtectedRoute>` layout route that gates the rest.
- **`App.jsx`** — layout shell only (header/nav + `<Outlet/>`). The header shows the logged-in user's `name` (falling back to email) + a **Logout** button (`logout()` → `/login`), or a **Log in** link when signed out (so anonymous `/play/:id` visitors can still reach login).
- **`components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`** — the login gate. Renders `<Outlet/>` for authed users, redirects the rest to `/login`. It also absorbs the magic-link landing: the backend's `GET /api/auth/verify` 302s to `/?login=success|error`, so `ProtectedRoute` strips `?login=success` once the session is loaded, and on `?login=error` (or any anonymous visit) redirects to `/login` carrying `state.linkError` so the login page explains the expired/invalid link.
- **`pages/`** — `LoginPage` (`/login`, email → `POST /api/auth/request` → generic "check your inbox" confirmation; no signup/password), `HomePage` (URL input → navigates to `/info?url=`), `InfoPage` (format selection), `DownloadPage` (`/download/:id`, runs the SSE), `DownloadsPage` (active + expired lists), `PlayPage` (`/play/:id`), `NotFoundPage`.
- **`context/HistoryContext.jsx`** is a **cache of the server's per-user history**, not a store: it loads `GET /api/files` on mount and again whenever the signed-in user changes (so a logout never leaves the previous user's list on screen), applies each mutation optimistically, and sends the matching request. It also clears the pre-0XC-100 `tubekeepHistory` / `tubekeepExpired` localStorage keys on mount (`LEGACY_HISTORY_KEYS`); nothing reads them.
- **`context/`** follows the same three-file split for every provider (React Fast Refresh / Biome's `useComponentExportOnlyModules` rule): `xContext.js` (`createContext` + constants), `XContext.jsx` (the provider with all logic), `useX.js` (the hook). This holds for `history*`, `player*`, and **`auth*`** (`authContext.js` / `AuthContext.jsx` / `useAuth.js`). Keep this separation when editing. `AuthProvider` loads `GET /api/auth/me` on mount and exposes `{ user, loading, login(email), logout(), refresh() }`; `user` is `{ email, name, max_storage_bytes }` or `null`.
- **Auth is cookie-based** — the session is a JWT httpOnly cookie the frontend never reads. `lib/media.js` exports **`apiFetch`**: a `credentials: 'include'` wrapper every same-origin API call routes through, which broadcasts the `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED_EVENT` (`tk:unauthorized`) window event on any 401 so `AuthProvider` drops the user and `ProtectedRoute` bounces to `/login` (session expired). SSE streams (`useDownloadProgress`, `useCloudMove`) pass `{ withCredentials: true }` for the same reason. The auth endpoints themselves (`/api/auth/*`) use plain credentialed `fetch` inside `AuthProvider`, **not** `apiFetch` — a 401 from `/me` is the normal "logged out" signal, not a session-expiry event, so it must not re-broadcast the event.
- **`components/`** — `UrlInput`, `FormatSelector`, `ProgressBar`, `VideoPlayer`, `ProtectedRoute`.
- **Share links:** `/play/:downloadId` is a stable shareable URL (the Share button copies `window.location.origin/play/:id`). It is **exempt from the login gate**, and `PlayPage` does a "cold" `GET /api/files` lookup when the download isn't in local context. Note that `/api/files` (the list) is itself session-gated (only `GET /api/files/:id/:filename` is public), and since 0XC-100 it returns only the **caller's own** rows, **only the owner can resolve a share link**. A non-owner (logged in or not) reaches the page but can't turn the id into a filename, so it renders as missing. Restoring cross-user sharing needs a public single-item metadata endpoint — tracked in 0XC-112, deliberately out of scope here.
- `VITE_API_URL` defaults to `window.location.origin` when unset (works in single-server mode).

### Styling system — non-obvious
There is **no Tailwind in `package.json`, no `tailwind.config.js`, and no PostCSS.** Tailwind is loaded at runtime from `cdn.tailwindcss.com` in `frontend/index.html`, and the entire Material Design 3 design-token theme (colors like `surface-container-high`, spacing like `gutter`/`stack-lg`, type scale like `headline-md`/`label-md`) is defined inline in the `<script id="tailwind-config">` block there. **To add or change a design token, edit `index.html`, not a config file.** Icons are Material Symbols via Google Fonts, used as `<span className="material-symbols-outlined">icon_name</span>`. Font is Space Grotesk. `App.css` holds a small amount of legacy plain-CSS for the video player.

## Code Conventions

**Frontend** — ES modules, **no semicolons**, single quotes, 2-space indent, ~100 col, functional components + hooks only. PascalCase component files; the file name matches the default export. Biome ignores unused vars/params prefixed with an underscore (`_foo`).

**Backend** — CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`), **semicolons**, single quotes, 2-space indent, camelCase files.

API responses are always `{ success: true, data: {...} }` or `{ success: false, error: '...' }`.

Log errors with emoji prefixes for grep-ability (e.g. `❌ Fetch error:`, `⚠️`, `🧹`, `🚀`).

## Deployment

CI/CD lives in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. On push to `main` (or manual dispatch):
1. Build a multi-stage Docker image (`Dockerfile`: frontend `npm run build` → Node 22 runtime with `ffmpeg` + `yt-dlp` installed via pip) and push to `ghcr.io/<repo>:latest`.
2. SSH to a Proxmox Docker host **through a Cloudflare Access tunnel** (`cloudflared access ssh`, using CF service-token secrets), then `cd /opt/tubekeep && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

`docker-compose.yml` runs that GHCR image, maps `3001:3001`, and bind-mounts `./downloads`. The legacy `deploy/ecosystem.config.js` (PM2) is **not** the active path — Docker is. There is no Caddyfile in this repo; TLS/routing is handled externally (Cloudflare).

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (Docker image uses Node 22)
- `yt-dlp` installed system-wide for local dev (`brew install yt-dlp` on macOS); `ffmpeg` is needed for video+audio merges.
